### Message from Shaurya
Some information on the website is outdated, and a few links are invalid. I'm planning to relaunch a better version of the site soon.

## Tech Stack

- Next.js
- Tailwind CSS
- Lucide Icons
- Million

## Get Started

1. Set up the configurations in `/src/data/config.js`:

   ```javascript
   URL = "snipc.me";
   EMAIL = `mail@snipc.me`;
   GIT_URL = "https://github.com/realsnipc/snipc-website";
   ```

2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Customize as needed, and you are good to go!

### Why I Opted for a New Website?
I'm creating a new website to start fresh with clean code and a simpler, more minimalist design.
