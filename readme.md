## Overview

This is a personal portfolio website built with Next.js, showcasing my skills, projects, and experiences.

This portfolio website is a modern, responsive web application built using **Next.js** (a React-based framework) and **Radix UI** components for UI elements. It is designed to showcase a variety of projects and provide visitors with an overview of my professional skills and work.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The website is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes and devices.
- **Radix UI**: For accessible and customizable UI components.
- **Fast and Optimized**: Built with Next.js, providing server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) for improved performance.
- **Smooth Navigation**: Single-page application (SPA) style navigation with dynamic route handling.
