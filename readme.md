## Overview

This is a personal portfolio website built with Next.js, showcasing my skills, projects, and experiences.

This portfolio website is a modern, responsive web application built using **Next.js** (a React-based framework) and **Tailwind CSS** component libraries for UI elements. It's a website about me, my interests, and my coding projects.

## Installation

To get started with the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/notsnip/website.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd website
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start the application at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Usage

Once the project is set up and running, you can:

- Edit your portfolio content (projects, skills, etc.) by modifying the files in the `app` and `components` directories.
- Add more functionality, such as contact forms, additional pages, or new components as needed.

The website supports dynamic routing via Next.js, and you can add more sections or pages as your portfolio grows.
